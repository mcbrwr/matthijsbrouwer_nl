The Kirby setup for my personal website matthijsbrouwer.nl. 
Not including the content files, I still like to use the kirby panel (cms) to write my stuff. It behaves good on mobile.

Feel free to look around. It is a side project, so not everything is as tidy as could be. And the code's a bit old so not everything is as I like to work now.

It's Work In Progress. See the current state here: http://matthijsbrouwer.nl
