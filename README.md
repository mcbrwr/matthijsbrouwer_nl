# matthijsbrouwer.nl
The Kirby setup for my personal website matthijsbrouwer.nl. 
Not including the content files, I still like to use the kirby panel (cms) to write my stuff. It behaves good on mobile.

Feel free to look around. It is a side project, so not everything is as tidy as could be. But it's quite like my usual workflow.

It's Work In Progress. Scheduled publication of the site is about somewhere this summer :-)
